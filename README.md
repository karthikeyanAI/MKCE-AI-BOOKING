**Verify Installation:**
   Open a new terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm are installed:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v

## Installing Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool for modern web development. Follow these steps to install Vite globally on your machine:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to install Vite globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g create-vite
   ```


This command will run the Vite executable from the remote npm repository. It will configure the necessary tools to scaffold a React local development environment. Finally, it will open a command-line menu for project settings and language type.

After the script finishes, you will be prompted to enter a project name:

```bash Output
